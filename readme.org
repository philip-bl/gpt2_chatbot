* GPT-2 chatbot
This a chatbot based on GPT-2 we, a team of 3, created during Deep learning 2019 course at
Skoltech. We fine tuned it on /Cornell movie dialogs corpus/ and /Omegle conversations
dataset/.

- It was quite popular for a while among Skoltech students. [[./vid2.mp4][Here]] you can see funny dialogs with
  our bot posted in Skoltech chat.
- You can read [[./report.pdf][the project report]] to learn about how it works and what exactly we did. The
  report describes two chatbots: generative, and retrieval-based. This repository contains only
  the generative chatbot.
- See [[./presentation.odp][our presentation]].
